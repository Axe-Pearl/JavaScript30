    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    //  const team = players;
    //  console.log(players,team);
   
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
      // team[3] = "other";
      // console.log(players,team); //but both players and team modified(reference)
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
       const team2 = players.slice();
       team2[3] = "team2";
       console.log("players:",players,"    team2 :",team2);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);
      team3[3] = "team3";
      console.log("players:",players,"    team3 :",team3);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
     const team4 = [...players];
     team4[3] = "team4";
     console.log("players:",players,"    team4 :",team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = "team5";
    console.log("players:",players,"    team5 :",team5);


    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Anurag',
      age: 21
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.numbers = 99;
    // console.log(person,captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({},person, {numbers:99,age:20});
    console.log("person: ",person," cap2: ",cap2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

  //  const dev = Object.assign({},anu);
  //  dev.name = "Axe-Pearl";
  //  console.log("anu: ",anu,"      dev: ",dev);//no problem till here

  //  dev.social.twitter = "@axe";
  //  console.log("anu: ",anu,"      dev: ",dev);// problem occurs

   //solution
